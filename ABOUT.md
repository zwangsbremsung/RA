Rail Announcement Generator; built by [Roy Curtis][0] in 2018, under the [MIT license][1].

[Source code for this application is freely available and forkable on GitHub][2].

Built using [TypeScript][3], [Stylus][4], [JetBrains WebStorm][5], and [Node][6].

Uses the [IcoMoon-Free icon pack by Keyamoon][7], the [5by7 font by Peter Wiegel][8],
the [Draggable library by Shopify][9], and impulse response recordings from the [Open AIR
library][22].

The VOX editor uses the [ElectronJS framework][18], the [LAME MP3 encoder][19] via the
[lamejs library by Alex Zhukov][20], and the [audiobuffer-to-wav encoder by
Matt DesLauriers and Matt Diamond][21].

With thanks to: [Paul Casillas][10] for his recordings of station announcements on
YouTube; [WhatDoTheyKnow][11] for hosting freedom of information request responses that
contain announcement data; "Mark" for making said FOI requests; [John Ball][17] for his
Welsh place name pronunciations; [various users on /r/AskUK for their help][23];
[Forvo][24] for their pronunciation commons (especially user [mooncow][25] for his
recordings of many UK place names); [Joe Thorpe][27], [Northwest Trainspotter 390][28],
and other YouTubers for their recordings of stations and level crossings with
pronunciations, and various StackOverflow contributors (where attributed) for code
snippets and advice.

Thank you also to [Stitch][12], [Spin][13], Tropic, Poster, Devon, [Robro][14], Grant,
Bjarke, Nik, Dylan, rjlan, Fyrrian, CGDoctor8, Mikko, Griffin, Leroy, Maitre, Shilo, Pat,
Toby and Kerys, [Kristi Kates and her entire community][15] for the love, testing, and
encouragement.

User-inputted and generated phrases may be sent to a remote server if a remote
text-to-speech engine (e.g. [Google's][26]) is used, or may be inferred from traffic logs
of servers hosting any VOX engine voices used.

No analytics, telemetry, or advertising is used, and they never will be.

Local storage is used only to store and recall JSON state, application settings, and user
choices. This is done implicitly and automatically, but is resettable.

This application uses phrases, vocabulary, and station names from [National Rail][16]'s
official station announcements, and freedom of information requests by other parties
that are not affiliated with this application.

This application is not affiliated with, nor endorsed by, National Rail or any of the rail
networks, companies, councils, towns and communities listed in datasets.

None of the messages generated by this application are endorsed by either National Rail or
any of the rail networks, companies, councils, towns and communities listed in the
datasets, or mentioned in such generated messages.

This application is just a hobby project; it is not meant for official use in any rail
station, nor any context where rail customers or spectators may be expecting official
information or announcements on train and station schedules.

This application is not meant as a replacement for, or extension of, official announcement
generating systems used in any rail station or train.

Obviously, I am not a lawyer, but I hope this text makes it clear enough that this is just
a hobby of mine, with zero commercial intent. Please enjoy, and thanks!
